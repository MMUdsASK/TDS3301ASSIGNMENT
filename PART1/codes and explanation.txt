plot( x = dataset$instant, y = dataset$weathersit)

From the graph we obtain from this code, we can conclude that from 2011 till 2012 the weather condition 1(Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy) took place the most during that period of time whereas weather condition 3(Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds) took place the least at that time duration. Weather condition 2(Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist) took place lesser than weather condion 1 and more than weather condition 3. Weather condition 4(Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog) never took place from 2011 till 2012. 

plot( x = dataset$casual, y = dataset$weathersit)

From the graph we obtain, we can conclude that the count of casual users is the highest in weather condition 1(Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy) and lowest during weather condition 3(Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds).

plot( x = dataset$registered, y = dataset$weathersit)

From the graph, we can conclude that count of registered users is higher in weather condition 1(Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy) than 2(Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist) and 3(Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered cloud) whereas weather condition 3(Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered cloud) has the lowest count of registered users.

plot( x = dataset$cnt, y = dataset$weathersit)

From the graph, we can conclude that the count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered is highest in weather conclusion 1(Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy), and lowest in weather condition 3(Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered cloud).
